Image classification aims to recognize semantic categories of objects in a given image. Object detection not only recognizes object categories, but also predicts the location of each object by a bounding box.

Here are some collections of review papers and some classic and state-of-art reseach papers focused on object dectection. The following figure shows the basic time line of classic research outputs.
