# Model Compression and Acceleration
#### This is a collection of papers focused on model compression and tricks, which are used for the speedup of calculations. If you want to know the area fastly, recommand to read the review papers, which can give you a whole picture.

## 1. Review papers
Here are several papers recommanded for the model compression and acceleration. 

- Cheng Yu et al., A survey of model compression and acceleration for deep neural networks, 2017. 

Refer to paper [A survey of model compression and acceleration for deep neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09282)

- Cheng Jian et al., Recent advances in efficient computation of deep convolutional neural networks, 2018.

Refer to paper [Recent advances in efficient computation of deep convolutional neural networks](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1631/FITEE.1700789.pdf)

- Deng Yunbin, Deep learning on mobile devices: a review, 2019.

## 2. Model compression and speedup approaches
Papers above have some overlapping areas, so in this section, I listed the survey into the following categories.
